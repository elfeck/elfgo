elfgo
===============================================================================
A very tiny Go/Baduk player based on Raphael (SVG, non-canvas) with sgf
support.

I did this mainly to use it on my website http://elfeck.com and because
https://github.com/jkk/eidogo seems to be no longer maintained and quite
bulky.

This JS code is a hack and horrible. Usage might lead to injury.
